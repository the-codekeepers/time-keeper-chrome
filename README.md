TimeKeeper is the ultimate timesheet logger for people who have a tendency to forget to log their work

This easy to use chrome extension will ask you at the start of every hour to log the work you have done over the last hour.

The extension allows you to log work at any time by clicking on its icon to reveal a popup with the log form.
A handy "recent logs" widget above the form let's you quickly add time to already existing logs

At the bottom of the log view you can open a timesheet in a new tab

The Timesheet view will let you see a summary of all the work you have logged over current month (month switching is in the roadmap).
The Timesheet view also allows you to manage your logs, enabling you to alter or delete logs.

Unlike traditional timesheet services, TimeKeeper is perfect for keeping track of extra-career activities (like taking breaks, or being blocked by technical difficulties) so that you can justify those days when you have only a few hours of work time. To do this, simply leave the "ticket" field blank and Timekeeper will default it to "other" for you.
